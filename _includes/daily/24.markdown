__Blog posts for this week:__

- report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team

- look at the license for the project that your team is working on and determine
what are the rules established by that license (what can one do, what is not
  allowed, what must one do)

- You should also update your "contributions" table with any new contributions
(do not include the team work in there).



__Presentation content:__
- brief intro to the project
- how complicated was the installation of development environment
- what went wrong
- what went well
- summary/descriptions of types of contributions that the team made
- how easy was it to collaborate within the team
- if you were doing this again, would you pick the same or different project
